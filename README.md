# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning-based Heart Disease Prediction System that predicts whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on various health parameters.

The model was built using Python and Scikit-Learn and deployed with Streamlit for an interactive user experience.
